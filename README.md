Problem 
This dynamic model describes a system of branches and balls.
At each intersection is a gate. When a ball passes a gate it will pass down the open side, but then the gate will move to the other side.
There are 15 balls and 16 containers. Which container will not receive a ball when all balls have passed through  the system
